Loop and Map Exercises 

This file contains the code for:

1. Finding the sum, product, largest, and smallest of five user input numbers that are stored in an array.  
2.  Using a hash map to create an inventory of vehicles that will give the user a predefined output based on availability of the type of vehicle they enter.  User can currently search for make, but I am still trying to work on being able to input make and get a return (not error!)
